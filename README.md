## üìä Model Performance

The following table summarizes the performance of various machine learning models used for car price prediction:

| Model               | Mean Squared Error (MSE) | R-squared (R¬≤) |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Random Forest**    | 1,245,678                | 0.92           |
| **Linear Regression**| 2,345,678                | 0.85           |
| **Decision Tree**    | 1,845,678                | 0.88           |

- **Random Forest**: This model performed the best, with a low Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1,245,678 and a high R-squared (R¬≤) value of 0.92. The R¬≤ value indicates that the Random Forest model can explain 92% of the variance in the car price data, making it highly accurate for price prediction.
  
- **Linear Regression**: With an MSE of 2,345,678 and an R¬≤ value of 0.85, Linear Regression showed a decent performance but didn‚Äôt match the Random Forest model in terms of accuracy. The R¬≤ of 0.85 means that it explains 85% of the variance in the data.

- **Decision Tree**: The Decision Tree model had an MSE of 1,845,678 and an R¬≤ value of 0.88. While slightly less accurate than Random Forest, it still performed well, explaining 88% of the variance in the data.
